\section{Introduction}

In this study we aim to further improve the performance of the classifier used to separate the process of interest
($t\bar{t}H$) from the background processes.

We have moved to the version 8 of the ntuples, and have also made changes to the optimization part itself. We have applied the
transformer architecture, experimented with fine-tuning, tried different weight configurations, and have experimented
with the training on the extended dataset, obtained by dropping all the selection cuts. We have experimented with
different feature sets, and have proposed an automated way of selecting the well-modelled features.

We have evaluated the uncertainty on the median signal strength parameter $\mu_{t\bar{t}H}$, considering both the
statistical and systematical uncertainties.
