\subsection{Automated well-modelling estimation}

This "well enough" usually just means that a person looks at the plots and decides if the agreement is good enough.
But we propose an automated way of doing this. As the algorithm is basically checking if the number of weighted events
in each bin is the same for the simulated and recorded data. However, only the bins where the signal to background ratio
is high enough are considered.

Each bin thus contributes to the well-modelling score. If the bin is blinded, the contribution is zero. Otherwise, the
contribution for the bin is:

$$
    \text{Bin Contribution} = 1 - \frac{N_\text{Recorded} - N_\text{Simulation}}{\max(N_\text{Recorded}, N_\text{Simulation})}
$$

Where $N_\text{Recorded}$ and $N_\text{Simulation}$ are the number of weighted events in the bin for the recorded and
simulated data respectively.

The total well-modelling score is then the mean of the contributions for all the bins.
